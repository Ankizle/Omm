//demonstration of how classes work in tusk
//  each file in a tusk program is a class, in a namespace
//  but the key difference from languages is that classes aren't the *focus* of the languages
//  while they have the same functionality as in java- they aim to only be used as custom datatypes/structures
//  without abstraction such as Manager and Factory classes
