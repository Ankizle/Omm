      Welcome to the Omm documentation. This is for the latest version of Omm.
      <br>
      <br>
      <h3>What is Omm?</h3>
      Omm is a general purpose mathematics programming language that is object-oriented and logic-oriented. It mantains a similar syntax to javascript but has many key differences. Omm is not a compiled programming language, as it is interpreted, but it is not fully interpreted. Omm makes a new branch of programming languages: "Parsed Programming". Omm is never truly sent into an interpreter/compiler. It does all of the actions while it is parsing. For this reason Omm is a powerhouse when it comes to mathematics and logic.
      <br>
      <br>
      <h3>Advantages of Omm</h3>
      As I said before Omm is a mathematical wonder. Yes, python has huge numbers and java has a long datatype, but neither of those languages have what Omm has, decimal precision. Python's near infinite number system is available in omm, but python's decimals are limited, very limited compared to omm. The maximum decimal in Omm is 2<sup>53</sup> - 1 digits long and so is the maximum integer. Slowly I will increase that number, but python pales in comparison to omm when it comes to numbers. Omm also has a lot of logic gates. Javascript has the basics, (&&, ||, and !), but omm has support of XORs NANDs, XNORs, etc. Javascript can handle these gates, but they require more code than in omm.

      <h3>Disadvantages of Omm</h3>
      Now that we have covered Omm's advantages, it is only fair that we cover the disadvantages. Being a parsed language comes with many benifits, but the main loss is efficiency. Omm has probably the worst efficiency when it comes to compuations and loops. In this case the precision of the numbers is to blame. Given a very high level of precision comes at a huge cost, which is in efficiency. If you are working in a field where efficiency is highly valued, you may want to consider using C++ or Rust.

      <h3>Download</h3>
      To download Omm go to <a href='/downloads.html'>this page</a> and pick the version you want. I recommend installing the latest tested version. Once you pick the version click the download button, and open the MSI file. Once you have done this complete the installation wizard. Then, Go to the directory that you installed omm to and copy it as text. Finally, go to your environment variables (by typing evirnonment variables in the search), go to the path system variable, add a new directory, and paste the directory you copied. I will soon simplify this process as I can see why it is complicated.
      <br>
      <br>
      <h3>Start</h3>
      Once you have downloaded Omm, create a new file named test.omm. To run an omm file just go to your working directory and in command prompt or powershell and type 'omm test.omm'. If you recieve an error then something has gone wrong in the installation process, or you are not in the directory of your file.
