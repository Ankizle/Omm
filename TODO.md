# TODO

- Add more default operator definitions

There isn't any way to add most integers, concat. strings, bitshift, and a lot more

- Add custom operator overloading

Coming soon

- Generics

Allow for mode DRY code

- Error Messages

Go just gives nil pointers when theres a compile-time error...
Not the best system in the world.

- Hashmaps

Most modern languages have built in support for these already

- For & For each loops

Pretty helpful
