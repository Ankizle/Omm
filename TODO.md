# TODO

- Add custom operator overloading

Coming soon

- Generics

Allow for mode DRY code

- Hashmaps

Most modern languages have built in support for these already

- For & For each loops

Pretty helpful

- Lambda functions

```
fn test() {
    var abcd = 1;
    var sub = fn() {
        abcd; //do stuff with abcd
    };
    sub();
}
```

this doesn't work still

- Standard library

Make one
